            <h2>Idea</h2>
            Me and my dad where trying to figure out a way for people to exchange messages that would be fully unhackable, Horcrux is the start of that.
            Only by both partys having the <b>Key</b> witch is an <b>BMP</b>(Bit Map) <b>image</b> would they be able to acsess the message.
            by using the Key and the python code in the <u>code tab</u> would they be able to read the messgaes!
            <br><br>
            <h2>Making</h2>
            The prosess of making Horcrux took 5 hours of nonstop coding and planning, and it worked beautifully when done.
            I decided to make a website because i enjoy trying new coding languages, i have never worked with HTML or CSS before starting this project.
            <br><br>
            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            To use Horcrux its somewhat simple, here are the steps to set up!
            <br><br>
            <b>1</b>-Download pyhon, you might have to find some youtube tutorials.
            <br><br>
            <b>2</b>-Create a new folder, perferably on a removeable drive for quick removeability.
            <br><br>
            <b>3</b>-Make 2 python files for Encripy and Decript, you can do this by making a text file and then saving as FileName.py (replace "FileName with Encript or whatever you want the name")
            <br><br>
            <b>4</b>-Make a simple "key" text document
            <br><br>
            <b>5</b>-Download or convert an image to BMP and know its path, this BMP image will be your key all the people that want to read your message have to have the same exact image.
            <br><br>
            <b>6</b>-Run The Code using the terminal, you probably can use any softwear but Visual Studio didnt work for me.
            <br><br>
            <b>7</b>-Enter File Path to .BMP image and .txt image,<b>Make sure you remove "" so it works</b> you can just right click the file and copy path FYI.
            <br><br>
            <b>8</b>-Enter Message and Click Encript, copy the text and that is your encripted code!
            <br><br>
            <b>8</b>-Enter message <b>With NO []</b> and click decrypt, and there you have your message!
            <br><br>

            and that is how with only 8 messages you can start sending messages!
            You shouldnt have to worry about where you send these as long as you dont send the key,
            if the key is on the internet then you could be at risk so make sure to be carefull. 
            The more complex the image the more secure the message will be.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            if you have any ideas on how this can be improved to be more secure then feel free to let us know! ps. the code will never be online because then there is a risk of hacking and we dont want that.
